Club it with a batch file and boom, you can schedule it with Task Scheduler on Windows 10.

## Requirements
You need python to run this.
You will also need to install Selenium Library

cd Attendance-Auto
```

```
The following are the subject codes (CS 2023): </br>

There's also a question in attendance.py asking your class. You might wanna edit that too if you're not CS.
